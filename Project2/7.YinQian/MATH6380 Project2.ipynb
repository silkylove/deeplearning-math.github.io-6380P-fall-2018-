    "## 1  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been one of the most successful models in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Remarkable progress in computer vision has been achieved by the successful structure design of CNNs, such as AlexNet [1], VGGNet [2], ResNet [3] and DenseNet [4]. The filters in CNNs corresponds to the weights that are learned from a large number of data. These filters are typically randomly initialized and then updated by using back-propagation training algorithm. As a result, the learned filters have no specific structures and could not be interpreted by humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Scattering Network (ScatNet) [5] was designed to use pre-fixed weights in CNNs for interpretability and it showed capacity to learn translation-invariant representations. Filters with improved properties have an impact on the efficiency and interpretability of CNNs, and help to understand deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To leverage filter generation mechanism of CNNs and ScatNet, the Decomposed Convolutional Filters network (DCF-Net) [6] decomposes convolutional filters in CNNs as a pre-fixed Fourier-Bessel (FB) bases, where the expansion coefficients are learned from the data in a supervised learning manner. In this way, it can lead to significant redundancy in the learned model. Experimental results showed the DCFNet yielded comparable and even improved classification accuracy on image datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we experimentally compare DCFNet with ResNet18 and VGGNet16 (with batch nomalization, VGGNet16_bn) for object classification task. We observe that on various object recognition datasets the classification accuracy are maintained with a significant reduction of the number of parameters, and the performance of Fourier-Bessel (FB) bases is constantly superior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contribution\n",
    "Both authors contribute equally to this project. More concretly:\n",
    "- **Kejing Yin** compared DCFNet with ResNet18.  \n",
    "- **Dong Qian** compared DCFNet with VGGNet16_bn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion on the results and the writing of the report are done by both authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Report\n",
    "In section 2, we introduce the dataset we used in this report. In section 3, we briefly introduce the DCF-Nets, VGG16 and ResNet18 models explored in this report followed by the object classification using the discussed models in section 4. Finally in section 5, we conclude the report and discuss the obtained results."

Specifically, suppose that the convolutional filters $W_{\\lambda^{'}, \\lambda}(u)$ at certain layer, after a proper rescaling of the spatial variable, are supported on the unit disk $D$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

    "### 5.1 Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we explored using the pre-fixed Fourier-Bessel (FB) bases to train a CNN where the coefficients of the bases are learned from data. We selected VGG16 and ResNet18 models as basic models and replaced the convolutional layers by DCF-FB layers. Experiments are carried out on CIFAR10 dataset. From the experiment results, we observe that the DCF-Nets are able to achieve comparable performance with the baseline CNN models with significantly less number of paramters, which is really impressive. Due to the significant decrease of number of parameters, the DCF-Nets can be trained much efficiently. Unfortunately, due to the time and GPU resources limit, we were not able to perform more comprehensive parameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Discussion\n",
    "Fourier-Bessel bases show capacity to capture the low-frequency components in the inputs and effectively ignore those high-frequency nuance details, which are often less stable and irrelevant for classification tasks. Other functional bases, such as standard Fourier bases or wavelet bases, may be introduced to improve model performance. Hopefully, the DCF layers can be incorporated in networks for learning the salient representations in an unsupervised manner. The stability and robustness analysis can be extended by testing the resilience to adversarial examples, which easily fool the state-of-the-art CNN architectures."
